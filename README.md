# image-classification-cifar10
Simple CNN model for CIFAR-10 image classification using PyTorch.
# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
The model is trained using PyTorch and achieves around 70% accuracy after 3 epochs.

## Features
- Custom CNN model
- CIFAR-10 dataset loading and preprocessing
- Training and testing pipeline
- Model saving & loading
- Custom image prediction (test.jpg)

## Files
- `image_classification.py` — main training and evaluation code
- `cifar10_model.pth` — saved trained model
- `test.jpg` — sample image for prediction
